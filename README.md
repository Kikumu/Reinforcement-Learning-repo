# Reinforcement-Learning-repo
A repo where I look into the details and practice on how to properly utilize reinforcement learning. I try out different AI models and evaluate their performance
to test out which does best. Please note this is a project i do in my free time and will update periodically when i get the time to complete it!

*Please note - running current model on cpu will be mind numbingly slow. I highly recommend either reducing network size (i.e parameters/layers/number of hidden layers) and reducing batch size(if running on cpu). Running on cuda cores is highly recommended*

## Phases(base line alg and setup).
1) Classic control(1/3): pendulum(done), mountain car, mountain car continuous.
2) Mujoco (0/10)
3) Robotics (0/10)

## Model(s) used/Evaluation metrics.
